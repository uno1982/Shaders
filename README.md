Create a changeset diff between UE5.4.3 (main) **BROKEN SHADOWS IN VR** and the below 
CL 33421853 - **(Was supposed to fix it in a hotfix but somehow missed merging into 5.4 for release)**
https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/2e67c280d893e48489a9ff06c5f59333a6e558a1

I've commited a Meta UE5.4.2 shaders branch for direct diff between UE5.4.3 and CL 33421853

I've patched broken a broken point light crash caused when trying to use CL 33421853 in 5.4.3 and added a branch for 5.4.4(fixes csm instanced stereo only)

Added Meta-5.4.3 for direct diff

Added 5.5.0-Preview-1 for direct diff (broken csm instanced stereo)
